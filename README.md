# CheatCode Media Group Coding Standards
This repository serves as a list of standards, guides and practices we stick to for open and closed source projects at CheatCode.

## Language Rules
### Java
We use Google's Java style guide.
* https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html

### JavaScript
We use AirBnB's JavaScript style guide (and ESLint for linting).
* https://github.com/airbnb/javascript

### PHP
We use PHP-FIG's PSR-12 PHP style guide.
* https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/

### Go
We use Go's own "Effective Go" guide as a style guide.
* https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html

## Git Commits
We use the standard for commits seen at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/

## Software Versioning
We use a semantic versioning system. Simply put, the software version should look like: `<Major>.<Minor>.<Patch>`.
